A coparison of some turn based strategy games using hexes for battle screens:
- megabattle 2: 9x7 (note: not using real hexes)
- heroes 2: 11x9
- heroes 3: 15x11
- eador - masters of the broken world: 8x8
- eador imperium: 12x12
- songs of conquest 12.5x9, but width is 13-12-13-12-...-13


Turn mechanics:
- heroes 3 - speed used for movement & initiative, units can wait for inverse order
- heroes 4 - movement controls movement, speed stat defines initiative, units can wait for inverse order
  - obstacles on the map are simply chokepoints
  - units attack at the same time with retaliation (unless 1st strike)

- eador
  - entire army turn (attacker first) - can choose units order individually
  - 1 unit stacks
  - move and atack, or attack without moving is similar in most cases
    - special moves (double arrow shot, round atack require more movement and stamina points)
  - obstacles on the map are just chokepoints
  - terrain type influences army performance
    - forest - range defence
    - swamp - negative defence and movement speed
    - hills - additional range and defence
  - units atack, get retaliated against (consumes enemy stamina)

- age of wonders
  - entire army turn (attacker first) - can choose units order individually
  - 1 unit stacks
  - units can attack multiple times, or walk and attack less (using action points).
  - units cannot wait, can skip
  - units atack, get retaliated against (order can change based on skills). can consume action points of target.
    - targets without action points can no longer retaliate -> surrounding stronger enemies is effective.
  - obstacles on the map can influence ballistics
  - RNG based hitting based on attack and defence ratings
